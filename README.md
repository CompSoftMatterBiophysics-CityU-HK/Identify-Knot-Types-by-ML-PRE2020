# Identify-Knot-Types-by-ML-PRE2020

To mark the 5-year anniversary of the knot type classification project, we provide **a docker, training code, best model with weights, and two showcases of generalizability**.
The work was published in Physical Review E as a research article titled "Identifying knot types of polymer conformations by machine learning".
