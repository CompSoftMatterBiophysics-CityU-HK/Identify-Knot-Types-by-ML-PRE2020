![cityuArticleBanner](/assets/CityuArticleBanner.jpg)

To mark the 5-year anniversary of the knot type classification project, we release this public repository to provide **a docker, training code, best model with weights, and two showcases of generalizability**.

The work was published in the Physical Review E journal in Febuary 2020 as a research article titled ["Identifying knot types of polymer conformations by machine learning"](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.101.022502):

This work, featured as the **APS Editors' Suggestion**, represented one of the first successful attempts of using deep learning to classify different knot types.
It has attracted a number of media coverage since.

## 0. Data Used in the Demo

We release the following data to accompany this demo repo:
- L60 circular knots (`L60_Lp4_D9`) five knot types:
  - Each knot type has 200K conformations, so 1 million conformations in total.
  - zipped as **`1M_L60_Lp4_D9_circular_knot0-31-41-52-51.tar.gz` [Download](https://zenodo.org/records/10938828/files/1M_L60_Lp4_D9_circular_knot0-31-41-52-51.tar.gz?download=1)**
- L100 circular knots (`L100_Lp2_D11`) five knot types:
  - Each knot type has 20K conformations, so 100K conformations in total.
  - zipped as **`Fig11_100K_L100_Lp2_D11_circular_knot0-31-41-52-51.tar.gz` [Download](https://zenodo.org/records/10938828/files/Fig11_100K_L100_Lp2_D11_circular_knot0-31-41-52-51.tar.gz?download=1)**

Both the `L60` and `L100` datasets are to classify five knot types: `knot-0`, `knot-31`, `knot-41`, `knot-52`, and `knot-51`.
Each conformation is represented as a txt file of 3D xyz coordinates.

The data are released as open public data on Zenodo at **[https://zenodo.org/records/10938828](https://zenodo.org/records/10938828)**

To download the data from Zenodo, either use command line tools line wget or curl, or directly download by clicking. **Download and save to `./data/` folder.**

To extract the data from `tar.gz`, run the following command:

```sh
# extract the five knot-type tar.gz files
cd ./data
tar -xzvf 1M_L60_Lp4_D9_circular_knot0-31-41-52-51.tar.gz
tar -xzvf Fig11_100K_L100_Lp2_D11_circular_knot0-31-41-52-51.tar.gz
```

## 1. Docker with Compatible TF2+CUDA+Py

We provide a `Dockerfile` to build a docker container based on `tensorflow:2.4.0-gpu-jupyter`.
The code we used for development from 5 years ago was based on `tensorflow-gpu==2.0.0`, but now we found the docker image `tensorflow:2.4.0-gpu-jupyter` also works.
The CUDA version for the docker is `CUDA 11`.
The advantage of using tensorflow with docker is you do not need to worry (too much) about CUDA versions.
The notebooks from this repo were generated using a laptop GPU (RTX 3080) with CUDA 11.4.

To build the docker, simply run the provided bash script `build.sh`.
Then launch the docker container by `run.sh`.
Note that we use `docker -v` flag with mounted volume (current dir) for jupyter dir (`/tf`).
The files from the current directory are used for the docker in run-time.

```sh
# create a custom docker image based on:
# - tensorflow:2.4.0-gpu-jupyter and CUDA 11
# - misc packages like matplotlib and scikit-learn
bash ./build.sh

# NOTE: the data are mounted in the next step bash run.sh
# data mounted are:
# - knot data folders
# - the best trained model+weights for inference
bash ./run.sh
```

**`run.sh` will first test if the GPU is avaiable, and then launch a jupyter notebook.**
Simply follow the text prompts and open the URL in your host web browser: `http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=...`

## 2. Training Code (Demo on L60 200K dataset)

We prepared a **jupyter notbook at [`./Demo_Train_L60_Classifier.ipynb`](./Demo_Train_L60_Classifier.ipynb)**
showcasing how to train a polymer knot-type classifier based on LSTM with Tensorflow.

The dataset used for this training notebook are five knot types of length `L60` and each knot type has 200K conformations.

This tutorial notebook reproduces the **L60 results from Table 1 from our publication**, i.e. training accuracy of ~99%, validation accuracy of ~98%, and evaluation on hold-out testset at ~98% accuracy.

## 3. Best Model with Weights (trained on L100 2M dataset)

The best RNN model for `L100` was a bidirectional LSTM stack with dropout trained on 2 million conformations for each knot type. The model with weights can be loaded directly (~10 MB) from this repo at **[`best_models/temp_20191103-175055_L100_2M_0-31-41-52-51-relative_BiLSTM240BiLSTM200Dp20BiLSTM180BiLSTM180BiLSTM100_.h5`](best_models/temp_20191103-175055_L100_2M_0-31-41-52-51-relative_BiLSTM240BiLSTM200Dp20BiLSTM180BiLSTM180BiLSTM100_.h5)**,
using `keras.models.load_model()`:

```py
# Best RNN model:
# Nov03 99.59acc BiLSTM stacks
best_model_dir = "best_models/"
save_model_name = best_model_dir + \
    "temp_20191103-175055_L100_2M_0-31-41-52-51-relative_BiLSTM240BiLSTM200Dp20BiLSTM180BiLSTM180BiLSTM100_.h5"

print("model to be used: ", save_model_name)

model = keras.models.load_model(save_model_name)

model.summary()
```

## 4. Generalize to L60 Sub-length

The notebook **[`Generalize_SubLength_L60_Fig7.ipynb`](Generalize_SubLength_L60_Fig7.ipynb)**
showcases the generalizability of `L100` classifier to identify knots in sublength polymer `L60`.
The model was
trained using polymer length `L100` and was asked to predict knot type labels on 1 million `L60` polymers.
This tutorial reproduces the Figure 7 (left panel) from the publication

## 5. Generalize to a Different Bending Stiffness

This notebook **[`Generalize_Bending_Stiffness_Fig11.ipynb`](Generalize_Bending_Stiffness_Fig11.ipynb)** loads the best weights for a trained model on `L100`, and predicts on unseen new conformations with **a different bending stiffness**.

In the body of the paper, the polymer conformations are
generated with a persistence length `Lp = 4a`. To examine
whether our model also works for polymer conformations with a
different bending stiffness, we generate `20 000` conformations
of `Lpolymer = 100` and `Lp = 2a` for each of the five knot types.
Then, we apply the RNN model trained from conformations with `Lp = 4a` to classify these new conformations with
`Lp = 2a`. The prediction accuracy is above `99%` for every
knot type, as shown in the Fig. 11 of our PRE publication:

<img src="assets/Fig11_L100_Lp2a_persistence_length.png" alt="Fig11_L100_Lp2a_persistence_length" width="35%"/>
These results suggest that the
prediction accuracy of our NN is insensitive to the bending
stiffness.
